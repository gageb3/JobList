Who: Designed for job seekers managing multiple applications, interviews, and follow-ups across different platforms. <br>
Value: Simplifies the job hunting process by displaying all job applications that the user has applied for, making the process more organized and optimal for the job searching process. <br>
Primary Metric: Reduces average time users spend manually managing job applications by 30%. <br>- If a user currently spends 10 hours a week organizing job applications, the app could reduce that to 7 hours a week.
