Project: [Job Application Tracker](https://github.com/gageb3/JobList/wiki/Demo-Script)

## USER STORY
As a job seeker<br>
I want to have a list of jobs I have applied to<br>
so that I can keep track of my applications better

## BLUF
**- What:** A web based job application tracker that helps users organize, monitor, and analyze their job search progress in one place. <br>
**- Who:** Designed for job seekers managing multiple applications, interviews, and follow-ups across different platforms. <br>
**- Value:** Simplifies the job hunting process by displaying all job applications that the user has applied for, making the process more organized and optimal for the job searching process. <br>
**- Primary Metric:** Reduces average time users spend manually managing job applications by 30%. <br>
- If a user currently spends 10 hours a week organizing job applications, the app could reduce that to 7 hours a week.

## MINIMUM ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- CRUD Operations: Users can create, view, update, and delete job applications with key details. Example: Company, Position, status, dates.
- Authentication: Secure signup/login with encrypted passwords and JWT tokens.
- Authorization: Role-Based Access (Admin)
- Notifications: Email reminders for interviews, deadlines, or follow-ups.
- RESTful API: Express.js routes handle all CRUD and auth operations
- Deployment: Staging on Render, production on Google Cloud (IaaS)
- Documentation: Full README, issues, Wiki, and project board.

## KM
- The Job Tracker App helps users keep all of their job search information in one organized place. It turns scattered notes, emails, and lists into an easy-to-use system where users can see what jobs they have applied for, track updates, and remember follow-ups. <br>
- This will save time by cutting out repetitive tasks like checking multiple sites or retyping the same details. The app helps users stay on top of their job search, avoid missing deadlines, and make better decisions using organized information.
