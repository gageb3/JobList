## ðŸ§¾ API Documentation (Swagger / OpenAPI)

Our REST API is documented using **Swagger UI** and **OpenAPI** standards.  
This allows developers and collaborators to understand, test, and extend our API easily.

### Overview

- Swagger UI is hosted at `/api/docs`.
- The documentation updates automatically as new routes are added.

### Purpose
